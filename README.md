# POWERBECK GYM&FITNESS

### THIS BRANCH IS ONLY USED TO SERVE SITE ON NETLIFY

Link: powerbeck.netlify.com

## THE SITE WORKS FINE ON GOOGLE CHROME 

## DOESNT WORK ON MOZILLA BECAUSE OF CORS POLICY

CORS does not allow to combine http and https requests :/ The Public SSL
Certificate is necessary. Unfortunatelly currently I dont have enough money
to buy domain for my backend and set the SSL Certificate.

# To checkout project just clone branch master then simply follow the instructions showed in README file ;)

1. Install Dependencies
2. Serve project on your local machine
3. Go to the http://localhost:8080/

I hope you will enjoy! :)
