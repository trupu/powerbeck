# POWERBECK FRONT-END API

## About
```
Project`s preview: http://188.68.232.79:8080
```
### Technological stack

```
MEVN: 
MongoDB - document oriented database to store some simple data like paragraphs` content,
Express.js - Node`s framework to simplyfy work with node,
Vue.js - JS Framework to simplyfy project`s structure and work with clientside javascript,
Node - JS Serverside Engine allowing to setup and work with backend API
```

### Description

```
The project was my first contact with Vue.js. I learned a lot of Vue`s methodology,
how to connect front & backend endpoints, how to work with axios / ES8 Promises,
how to take care of code clarity, logically organize folders and project data. Furthermore, I`ve been working with git repository and webpack.
The project is finished in about 95%. There is lack of contact form, since i had an idea to replace it with passes menu. Perhaps I`ll comeback to this project in the future and finish it completely.
One may have noticed the fact that Powerbeck works on external IP instead of domain. Yeah, someday i`ll buy a domain and configure SSL Certificates for my backend API :D
